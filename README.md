Professional Invaders
=====================
Have fun surviving attacks from your professional network!

A bit of history 
-----------------
This funny game came out of a couple of hackdays at the Amsterdam's [Kings of Code Hackbattle](http://hackbattle.thenextweb.com/index.php/TNW_Kings_of_Code_Hack_Battle_-_Amsterdam_2013) which we (@abahgat and @alexdeleon) attended in April 2013. The original hack was a matchup of some of the API parters of the event: [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com), [SendGrid](http://www.sendgrid.com/), [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com), and Braintree (https://www.braintreepayments.com/). However, the version that you see and play here is a simplification of the original one which make more appropiate for a fun Web game.
